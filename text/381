And it’s usual for the prisoner’s mother to change
clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out
in her clothes. We’ll do that, too.”

“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to {{warn}}
anybody for that something’s up? Let them find it
out for themselves – it’s their lookout.”

“Yes, I know; but you can’t depend on them.
It’s the way they’ve acted from the very start – left
us to do {{everything}}. They’re so confiding and mullet-headed
they don’t take notice of nothing at all. So
if we don’t {{give}} them notice there won’t be nobody
nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our
hard work and trouble this escape ’ll go off perfectly
flat; won’t amount to nothing – won’t be nothing
{{to}} it.”

“Well, as for me, Tom, that’s the way I’d like.”

“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:

“But I ain’t going to make no complaint. Any
way that suits you suits me. What you going to
do about the servant-girl?”

“You’ll be her. You slide in, in the middle of
the night, and hook that yaller girl’s frock.”

“Why, Tom, that ’ll make trouble next morning;
because, of course, she prob’bly hain’t got any but
that one.”

“I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes,
to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it
under the front door.”

“All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just
as handy in my own togs.”

“You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl {{then}}, would
you?”
