Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn't
say nothing because they wanted to go to England;
and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane
was off working for the auction than around in reach
of Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I
had done it pretty neat--I reckoned Tom Sawyer
couldn't 'a' done it no neater himself. Of course he
would 'a' throwed more style into it, but I can't do
that very handy, not being brung up to it.

Well, they held the auction in the public square,
along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strung
along, and strung along, and the old man he was on
hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside
of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture
now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of
some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing
for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading
himself generly.

But by and by the thing dragged through, and
everything was sold--everything but a little old
trifling lot in the graveyard. So they'd got to work
{{that}} off--I never see such a girafft as the king was
for wanting to swallow {{everything}}. Well, whilst they
was at it a steamboat landed, and in about two
minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling
and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:

"{{Here's}} your opposition line! here's your two sets
o' heirs to old Peter Wilks--and you pays your
money and you takes your choice!"
