it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see
him. I says:

"Hello, Jim!" and skipped out.

He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he
drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together
and says:

"Doan' hurt me--don't! I hain't ever done no
harm to a ghos'. I alwuz liked dead people, en done
all I could for 'em. You go en git in de river ag'in,
whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at
'uz alwuz yo' fren'."

Well, I warn't long making him understand I
warn't dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I
warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't afraid of
{{him}} telling the people where I was. I talked along,
but he only set there and looked at me; never said
nothing. Then I says:

"It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make
up your camp-fire good."

"What's de use er makin' up de camp-fire to cook
strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain't
you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries."

"Strawberries and such truck," I says. "Is that
what you live on?"

"I couldn' git nuffn else," he says.

"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"

"I come heah de night arter you's killed."

"What, all that time?"

"Yes-indeedy."

"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"

"No, sah--nuffn else."
