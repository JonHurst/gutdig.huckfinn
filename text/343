one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we can tear
up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.
And we can send it to him in a pie; it's
mostly done that way. And I've et worse pies."

"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jim
ain't got no use for a rope ladder."

"He {{has}} got use for it. How {{you}} talk, you better
say; you don't know nothing about it. He's {{got}} to
have a rope ladder; they all do."

"What in the nation can he {{do}} with it?"

"{{Do}} with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he?
That's what they all do; and {{he's}} got to, too.
Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do anything
that's regular; you want to be starting something
fresh all the time. S'pose he {{don't}} do nothing with
it? ain't it there in his bed, for a clue, after he's
gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clues? Of
course they will. And you wouldn't leave them
any? That would be a {{pretty}} howdy-do, {{wouldn't}} it!
I never heard of such a thing."

"Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he's
got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I
don't wish to go back on no regulations; but there's
one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up our
sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get
into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're
born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder
don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and
is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a
straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for
Jim, he ain't had no experience, and so {{he}} don't care
what kind of a--"
