"I know, but--"

"Well, I'll count 'm again."

So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same
as the other time. Well, she {{was}} in a tearing way--just
a-trembling all over, she was so mad. But
she counted and counted till she got that addled
she'd start to count in the {{basket}} for a spoon sometimes;
and so, three times they come out right, and
three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed
up the basket and slammed it across the house and
knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cler out
and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering
around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd
skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it
in her apron pocket whilst she was a-giving us our
sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with
her shingle-nail, before noon. We was very well
satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was
worth twice the trouble it took, because he said {{now}}
she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike
again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd
counted them right if she {{did}}; and said that after
she'd about counted her head off for the next three
days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody
that wanted her to ever count them any more.

So we put the sheet back on the line that night,
and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting
it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till
she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,
and she didn't {{care}}, and warn't a-going to bullyrag
the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn't count
them again not to save her life; she druther die first.
