started or whether I warn't. When I was fifty
yards off, Jim says:

"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white
genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole Jim."

Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I {{got}} to do it--I
can't get {{out}} of it. Right then along comes a skiff
with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and
I stopped. One of them says:

"What's that yonder?"

"A piece of a raft," I says.

"Do you belong on it?"

"Yes, sir."

"Any men on it?"

"Only one, sir."

"Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up
yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man
white or black?"

I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but the
words wouldn't come. I tried for a second or two
to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man
enough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was
weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and
says:

"He's white."

"I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves."

"I wish you would," says I, "because it's pap
that's there, and maybe you'd help me tow the raft
ashore where the light is. He's sick--and so is mam
and Mary Ann."

"Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. But I
s'pose we've got to. Come, buckle to your paddle,
and let's get along."
