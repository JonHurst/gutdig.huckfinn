crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t
get some berries. Just as I was passing a place where
a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a
couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they
could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever
anybody was after anybody I judged it was {{me}} – or
maybe Jim. I was about to dig out from there in a
hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung
out and begged me to save their lives – said they
hadn’t been doing nothing, and was being chased for
it – said there was men and dogs a-coming. They
wanted to jump right in, but I says:

“Don’t you do it. I don’t hear the dogs and horses
yet; you’ve got time to crowd through the brush and
get up the crick a little ways; then you take to the
water and wade down to me and get in – that ’ll throw
the dogs off the scent.”

They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit
out for our towhead, and in about five or ten minutes
we heard the dogs and the men away off,
shouting. We heard them come along towards the
crick, but couldn’t see them; they seemed to stop
and fool around awhile; then, as we got further and
further away all the time, we couldn’t hardly hear
them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods
behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet,
and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the
cottonwoods and was safe.

One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards,
and had a bald head and very gray whiskers.
He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a
greasy blue woolen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans
