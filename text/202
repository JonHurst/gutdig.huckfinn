been whitewashed some time or another, but the
duke said it was in Columbus’s time, like enough.
There was generly hogs in the garden, and people
driving them out.

All the stores was along one street. They had white
domestic awnings in front, and the country-people
hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There
was empty dry-goods boxes under the awnings, and
loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them
with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and
gaping and yawning and stretching – a mighty ornery
lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as
wide as an umbrella, but didn’t wear no coats nor
waistcoats; they called one another Bill, and Buck,
and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and
drawly, and used considerable many cuss-words.
There was as many as one loafer leaning up against
every awning-post, and he most always had his hands
in his britches pockets, except when he fetched them
out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a
body was hearing amongst them all the time was:

“Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.”

“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.”

Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and
says he ain’t got none. Some of them kinds of
loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of
tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by
borrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’
me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson
the last chaw I had” – which is a lie pretty much
every time; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but
Jack ain’t no stranger, so he says:
