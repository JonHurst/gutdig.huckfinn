and went out of sight around the shoulder of the
island. I could hear the booming now and then,
further and further off, and by and by, after an hour,
I didn’t hear it no more. The island was three mile
long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was

stay so, you soon get over it.

And so for three days and nights. No difference – just
the same thing. But the next day I went exploring
