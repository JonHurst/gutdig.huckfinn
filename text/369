So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a
brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his'n out of the brass
and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to
work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he
said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly
know which to take, but there was one which he
reckoned he'd decide on. He says:

"On the scutcheon we'll have a bend {{or}} in the
dexter base, a saltire {{murrey}} in the fess, with a dog,
couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a
chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron {{vert}} in
a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field
{{azure}}, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette
indented; crest, a runaway nigger, {{sable}}, with his
bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a
couple of gules for supporters, which is you and
me; motto, {{Maggiore fretta, minore atto}}. Got it out
of a book--means the more haste the less speed."

"Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest
of it mean?"

"We ain't got no time to bother over that," he
says; "we got to dig in like all git-out."

"Well, anyway," I says, "what's {{some}} of it?
What's a fess?"

"A fess--a fess is--{{you}} don't need to know what
a fess is. I'll show him how to make it when he gets
to it."

"Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell
a person. What's a bar sinister?"

"Oh, {{I}} don't know. But he's got to have it.
All the nobility does."

That was just his way. If it didn't suit him to explain
