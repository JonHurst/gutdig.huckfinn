quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and
keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead
of me, and crossed me off. She says, "Take your
hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are
always making!" The widow put in a good word
for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad
luck, I knowed that well enough. I started out,
after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and
wondering where it was going to fall on me, and
what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off
some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them
kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked
along low-spirited and on the watch-out.

I went down to the front garden and clumb over
the stile where you go through the high board fence.
There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and
I seen somebody's tracks. They had come up from
the quarry and stood around the stile awhile, and
then went on around the garden fence. It was
funny they hadn't come in, after standing around
so. I couldn't make it out. It was very curious,
somehow. I was going to follow around, but I
stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn't
notice anything at first, but next I did. There was
a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to
keep off the devil.

I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.
I looked over my shoulder every now and then,
but I didn't see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher's
as quick as I could get there. He said:

"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did
you come for your interest?"
