and do you reckon anybody’s going to resk his
life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this,
when it’s likely to break up and wash off down the
river any minute?” Jim couldn’t say nothing to
that, so he didn’t try. “And besides,” I says, “we
might borrow something worth having out of the
captain’s stateroom. Seegars, {{I}} bet you – and cost

spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it
was so dark we couldn’t see no sign of them. Pretty
soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and
clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front
