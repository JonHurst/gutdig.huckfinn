a cat?"

"No, dey don't."

"It's natural and right for 'em to talk different
from each other, ain't it?"

"Course."

"And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a
cow to talk different from {{us}}?"

"Why, mos' sholy it is."

"Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a
{{Frenchman}} to talk different from us? You answer
me that."

"Is a cat a man, Huck?"

"No."

"Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like
a man. Is a cow a man?--er is a cow a cat?"

"No, she ain't either of them."

"Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk like
either one er the yuther of 'em. Is a Frenchman
a man?"

"Yes."

"{{Well}}, den! Dad blame it, why doan' he {{talk}} like
a man? You answer me {{dat!"}}
