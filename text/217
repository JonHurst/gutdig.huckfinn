and everybody just a-howling with pleasure
and astonishment.

Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled,
and he {{was}} the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I
reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had
got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let
on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be
took in so, but I wouldn’t ’a’ been in that ringmaster’s
place, not for a thousand dollars. I don’t know;
there may be bullier circuses than what that one
was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was
plenty good enough for {{me}}; and wherever I run
across it, it can have all of {{my}} custom every time.

Well, that night we had {{our}} show; but there warn’t
only about twelve people there – just enough to pay
expenses. And they laughed all the time, and that
made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway,
before the show was over, but one boy which was
asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads
couldn’t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted
was low comedy – and maybe something ruther worse
than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size
their style. So next morning he got some big sheets of
wrapping-paper and some black paint, and drawed off
some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.
The bills said:

{{The World-Renowned Tragedians}}
DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!
AND
EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!
