of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy,
away down through the texas-hall we see a
light! and all in the same second we seem to hear
low voices in yonder!

Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful
sick, and told me to come along. I says, all right,
and was going to start for the raft; but just then I
heard a voice wail out and say:

"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"

Another voice said, pretty loud:

"It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way
before. You always want more'n your share of the
truck, and you've always got it, too, because you've
swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time
you've said it jest one time too many. You're the
meanest, treacherousest hound in this country."

By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was
just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself,
Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now, and so I won't
either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So
I dropped on my hands and knees in the little
passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn't
but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of
the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on
the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing
over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in
his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one
kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the
floor, and saying:

"I'd {{like}} to! And I orter, too--a mean skunk!"

The man on the floor would shrivel up and say,
"Oh, please don't, Bill; I hain't ever goin' to tell."
