or along there, though he was a little bigger
than me. He hadn't on anything but a shirt, and
he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and
digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging
a gun along with the other one. He says:

"Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?"

They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.

"Well," he says, "if they'd 'a' ben some, I reckon
I'd 'a' got one."

They all laughed, and Bob says:

"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all,
you've been so slow in coming."

"Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right.
I'm always kept down; I don't get no show."

"Never mind, Buck, my boy," says the old man,
"you'll have show enough, all in good time, don't
you fret about that. Go 'long with you now, and
do as your mother told you."

catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he
asked me where Moses was when the candle went
out. I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it
before, no way.

"Well, guess," he says.

"How'm I going to guess," says I, "when I never
heard tell of it before?"

"But you can guess, can't you? It's just as easy."

"{{Which}} candle?" I says.
