two young women which I couldn't see right well.
The old gentleman says:

"There; I reckon it's all right. Come in."

As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked
the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the
young men to come in with their guns, and they all
went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on
the floor, and got together in a corner that was out
of the range of the front windows--there warn't none
on the side. They held the candle, and took a good
look at me, and all said, "Why, {{he}} ain't a Shepherdson--no,
there ain't any Shepherdson about him."
Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn't mind
being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no
harm by it--it was only to make sure. So he didn't
pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his
hands, and said it was all right. He told me to
make myself easy and at home, and tell all about
myself; but the old lady says:

"Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as
he can be; and don't you reckon it may be he's
hungry?"

"True for you, Rachel--I forgot."

So the old lady says:

"Betsy" (this was a nigger woman), "you fly
around and get him something to eat as quick as you
can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake
up Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself. Buck,
take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off
from him and dress him up in some of yours that's
dry."

Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen
