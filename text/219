CHAPTER XXIII

Well, all day him and the king was hard at it,
rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of
candles for footlights; and that night the house was
jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn’t
hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went
around the back way and come onto the stage and
stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,
and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most
thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging
about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean
the Elder, which was to play the main principal part
in it; and at last when he’d got everybody’s expectations
up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and
the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all
fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped,
all sorts of colors, as splendid
as a rainbow. And – but never mind the rest of his
outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The
people most killed themselves laughing; and when
the king got done capering and capered off behind
the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed
and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over
again, and after that they made him do it another
time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the
shines that old idiot cut.
