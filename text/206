“Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.
If he’d a-chawed up all the men he’s ben a-gwyne to
chaw up in the last twenty year he’d have considerable
ruputation now.”

Another one says, “I wisht old Boggs ’d threaten
me, ’cuz then I’d know I warn’t gwyne to die for
a thousan’ year.”

Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping
and yelling like an Injun, and singing out:

“Cler the track, thar. I’m on the waw-path, and
the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise.”

He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle;
he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face.
Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and
sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he’d attend
to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but
he couldn’t wait now because he’d come to town to
kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, “Meat
first, and spoon vittles to top off on.”

He see me, and rode up and says:

“Whar’d you come f’m, boy? You prepared to die?”

Then he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:

“He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’
on like that when he’s drunk. He’s the best-naturedest
old fool in Arkansaw – never hurt nobody, drunk
nor sober.”

Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and
bent his head down so he could see under the curtain
of the awning and yells:

“Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet
the man you’ve swindled. You’re the houn’ I’m
after, and I’m a-gwyne to have you, too!”
