nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend
any boy I ever see. He knowed how to
do everything.

Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough
to get the grindstone through; but Jim he took the
pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom
marked out them things on it with the nail, and set
Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and
an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a
hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his
candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed,
and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and
sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his chain back
on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.
But Tom thought of something, and says:

"You got any spiders in here, Jim?"

"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."

"All right, we'll get you some."

"But bless you, honey, I doan' {{want}} none. I's
afeard un um. I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."

Tom thought a minute or two, and says:

"It's a good idea. And I reckon it's been done.
It {{must}} 'a' been done; it stands to reason. Yes, it's
a prime good idea. Where could you keep it?"

"Keep what, Mars Tom?"

"Why, a rattlesnake."

"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why,
if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en
bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my
head."

"Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a
little. You could tame it."
