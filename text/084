thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with
a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that
was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long,
and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn’t

and tied it under my chin, and then for a
body to look in and see my face was like looking
down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would
