was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young
chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was
the same way when young birds done it. I was going
to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn’t let me. He
said it was death. He said his father laid mighty
sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his
old granny said his father would die, and he did.

And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you
are going to cook for dinner, because that would
bring bad luck. The same if you shook the tablecloth
after sundown. And he said if a man owned
a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told
about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees
would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim
said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe
that, because I had tried them lots of times myself,
and they wouldn’t sting me.

I had heard about some of these things before,
but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs.
He said he knowed most everything. I said it
looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck,
and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck
signs. He says:

“Mighty few – an’ {{dey}} ain’t no use to a body.
What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’
for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s
got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s
a-gwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign
like dat, ’kase it’s so fur ahead. You see, maybe
you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so you might
git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ’f you didn’ know by
de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”
