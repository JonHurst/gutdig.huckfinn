a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be
long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help
you tell them your folks are all down with chills and
fever. Don't be a fool again, and let people guess
what is the matter. Now we're trying to do you a
kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us,
that's a good boy. It wouldn't do any good to land
yonder where the light is--it's only a wood-yard.
Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound
to say he's in pretty hard luck. Here, I'll put a
twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get
it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave
you; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox,
don't you see?"

"Hold on, Parker," says the man, "here's a
twenty to put on the board for me. Good-by, boy;
you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll be all
right."

"That's so, my boy--good-by, good-bye. If you
see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them,
and you can make some money by it."

"Good-by, sir," says I; "I won't let no runaway
niggers get by me if I can help it."

They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling
bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done
wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me to try to
learn to do right; a body that don't get {{started}} right
when he's little ain't got no show--when the pinch
comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep
him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I thought
a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd
'a' done right and give Jim up, would you felt better
