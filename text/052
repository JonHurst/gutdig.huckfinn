what made me so long. I knowed he would see I
was wet, and then he would be asking questions.
We got five catfish off the lines and went home.

While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both
of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I
could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow
from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing
than trusting to luck to get far enough off before
they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might
happen. Well, I didn't see no way for a while, but
by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another
barrel of water, and he says:

"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here
you roust me out, you hear? That man warn't here
for no good. I'd a shot him. Next time you roust
me out, you hear?"

Then he dropped down and went to sleep again;
what he had been saying give me the very idea I
wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody
won't think of following me.

About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along
up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast,
and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By and

together. We went out with the skiff and towed it
ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap
would 'a' waited and seen the day through, so as to
catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style. Nine
logs was enough for one time; he must shove right
over to town and sell. So he locked me in and took
the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half
past three. I judged he wouldn't come back that
