didn’t know nothing at all the rest of the day, and
preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that
gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest
man in the world couldn’t ’a’ understood it. So Tom’s
Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what;
and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight
place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer – she
chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me
Aunt Sally, I’m used to it now, and ’taint no need
to change” – that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom
Sawyer I had to stand it – there warn’t no other way,
and I knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would
be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he’d make an
adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And
so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made
things as soft as he could for me.

And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about
old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so,
sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that
trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I
couldn’t ever understand before, until that minute
and that talk, how he {{could}} help a body set a nigger
free with his bringing-up.

Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally
wrote to her that Tom and {{Sid}} had come all right
and safe, she says to herself:

“Look at that, now! I might have expected it,
letting him go off that way without anybody to
watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the
way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find
out what that creetur’s up to {{this}} time, as long as I
couldn’t seem to get any answer out of you about it.”
