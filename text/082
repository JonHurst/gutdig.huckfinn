“Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don’t
you git too peart. It’s a-comin’. Mind I tell you,
it’s a-comin’.”

It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had
that talk. Well, after dinner Friday we was laying
around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and
got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get
some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed
him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim’s blanket,
ever so natural, thinking there’d be some fun when
Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all
about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down
on the blanket while I struck a light the snake’s
mate was there, and bit him.

He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light
showed was the varmint curled up and ready for
another spring. I laid him out in a second with a
stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun
to pour it down.

He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right
on the heel. That all comes of my being such a
fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a
dead snake its mate always comes there and curls
around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake’s
head and throw it away, and then skin the body and
roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said
it would help cure him. He made me take off the
rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said
that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and
throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes;
for I warn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my
fault, not if I could help it.
