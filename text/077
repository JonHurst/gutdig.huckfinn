barrels down-stairs – where it’s long stairs and they
bounce a good deal, you know.

“Jim, this is nice,” I says. “I wouldn’t want to
be nowhere else but here. Pass me along another
hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.”

“Well, you wouldn’t ’a’ ben here ’f it hadn’t ’a’ ben
for Jim. You’d ’a’ ben down dah in de woods widout
any dinner, en gittin’ mos’ drownded, too; dat you
would, honey. Chickens knows when it’s gwyne to
rain, en so do de birds, chile.”

The river went on raising and raising for ten or
twelve days, till at last it was over the banks. The
water was three or four foot deep on the island in
the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that
side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri
side it was the same old distance across – a half
a mile – because the Missouri shore was just a wall
of high bluffs.

Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the
canoe. It was mighty cool and shady in the deep
woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We went
winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes
the vines hung so thick we had to back away and
go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down
tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such
things; and when the island had been overflowed a
day or two they got so tame, on account of being
hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your
hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes
and turtles – they would slide off in the water. The
ridge our cavern was in was full of them. We could
’a’ had pets enough if we’d wanted them.
