as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this
time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not for
a salary.

Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in
pretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in
a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up
and write a line in his journal whilst the ink was
fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on
was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was
sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it
give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned
we was all going to die, but didn't. It was the most
undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the
same. But as I was saying, we'd got all the work
done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged
out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote
a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to
come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got
no answer, because there warn't no such plantation;
so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis
and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the
St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see
we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now for
the nonnamous letters.

"What's them?" I says.

"Warnings to the people that something is up.
Sometimes it's done one way, sometimes another.
But there's always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle. When
Louis XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries a
servant-girl done it. It's a very good way, and so
is the nonnamous letters. We'll use them both.
