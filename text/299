“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the
deffersit; it warn’t me.”

“Dry up! I don’t want to hear no more {{out}} of
you!” says the duke. “And {{now}} you see what you
{{got}} by it. They’ve got all their own money back,
and all of {{ourn}} but a shekel or two {{besides}}. G’long
to bed, and don’t you deffersit {{me}} no more deffersits,
long ’s {{you}} live!”

So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to
his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke
tackled {{his}} bottle; and so in about a half an hour
they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter
they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring
in each other’s arms. They both got powerful mellow,
but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough
to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the
money-bag again. That made me feel easy and
satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had
a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.
