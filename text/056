and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw,
for there warn’t no knives and forks on the place – pap
done everything with his clasp-knife about the
cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred
yards across the grass and through the willows east
of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile
wide and full of rushes – and ducks too, you might
say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek
leading out of it on the other side that went miles
away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the
river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all
the way to the lake. I dropped pap’s whetstone
there too, so as to look like it had been done by
accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal-sack
with a string, so it wouldn’t leak no more, and
took it and my saw to the canoe again.

It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe
down the river under some willows that hung over the
bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to
a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid
down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.
I says to myself, they’ll follow the track of that sackful
of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for
me. And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake
and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to
find the robbers that killed me and took the things.
They won’t ever hunt the river for anything but my
dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and
won’t bother no more about me. All right; I can
stop anywhere I want to. Jackson’s Island is good
enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and
nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle
