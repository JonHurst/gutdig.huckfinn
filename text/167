I took up the river road as hard as I could put.
By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off.
When I came in sight of the log store and the woodpile
where the steamboats lands I worked along
under the trees and brush till I got to a good place,
and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood
that was out of reach, and watched. There was a
wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of
the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that;
but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.

There was four or five men cavorting around on
their horses in the open place before the log store,
cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of
young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside
of the steamboat-landing; but they couldn’t
come it. Every time one of them showed himself
on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.
The two boys was squatting back to back behind the
pile, so they could watch both ways.

By and by the men stopped cavorting around
and yelling. They started riding towards the
store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them
out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their
horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry
him to the store; and that minute the two boys
started on the run. They got half-way to the tree
