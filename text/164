pretty soon the trees hid him. I poked into the
place a ways and come to a little open patch as big as
a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a
man laying there asleep – and, by jings, it was my
old Jim!

I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be
a grand surprise to him to see me again, but it warn’t.
He nearly cried he was so glad, but he warn’t surprised.
Said he swum along behind me that night,
and heard me yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because
he didn’t want nobody to pick {{him}} up and take
him into slavery again. Says he:

“I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz
a considerable ways behine you towards de las’; when
you landed I reck’ned I could ketch up wid you on de
lan’ ’dout havin’ to shout at you, but when I see dat
house I begin to go slow. I ’uz off too fur to hear
what dey say to you – I wuz ’fraid o’ de dogs; but
when it ’uz all quiet ag’in I knowed you’s in de house,
so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early
in de mawnin’ some er de niggers come along, gwyne
to de fields, en dey tuk me en showed me dis place,
whah de dogs can’t track me on accounts o’ de water,
en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me
how you’s a-gittin’ along.”

“Why didn’t you tell my Jack to fetch me here
sooner, Jim?”

“Well, ’twarn’t no use to ’sturb you, Huck, tell we
could do sumfn – but we’s all right now. I ben a-buyin’
pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin’
up de raf’ nights when – ”

“{{What}} raft, Jim?”
