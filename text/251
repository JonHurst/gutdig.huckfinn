"Why, they're for {{style}}. Don't you know nothing?"

"Well, I don't {{want}} to know no such foolishness as
that. How is servants treated in England? Do they
treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers?"

"{{No!}} A servant ain't nobody there. They treat
them worse than dogs."

"Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do,
Christmas and New Year's week, and Fourth of
July?"

"Oh, just listen! A body could tell {{you}} hain't ever
been to England by that. Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna,
they never see a holiday from year's end to
year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor
nigger shows, nor nowheres."

"Nor church?"

"Nor church."

"But {{you}} always went to church."

Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old
man's servant. But next minute I whirled in on a
kind of an explanation how a valley was different
from a common servant, and {{had}} to go to church
whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family,
on account of its being the law. But I didn't do it
pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn't
satisfied. She says:

"Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a
lot of lies?"

"Honest injun," says I.

"None of it at all?"

"None of it at all. Not a lie in it," says I.

"Lay your hand on this book and say it."
