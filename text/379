the old man so that he said he could most wish there
hadn’t ever been no snakes created. Why, after
every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn’t over
it yet; she warn’t near over it; when she was setting
thinking about something you could touch her on the
back of her neck with a feather and she would jump
right out of her stockings. It was very curious.
But Tom said all women was just so. He said they
was made that way for some reason or other.

We got a licking every time one of our snakes come
in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn’t
nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up
the place again with them. I didn’t mind the lickings,
because they didn’t amount to nothing; but I
minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot.
But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and
you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s was
when they’d all swarm out for music and go for him.
Jim didn’t like the spiders, and the spiders didn’t like
Jim; and so they’d lay for him, and make it mighty
warm for him. And he said that between the rats
and the snakes and the grindstone there warn’t no
room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was,
a body couldn’t sleep, it was so lively, and it was
always lively, he said, because {{they}} never all slept at
one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes
was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats
turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always
had one gang under him, in his way, and t’other gang
having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt
a new place the spiders would take a chance at him
