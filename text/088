dollars. And there’s a reward out for old Finn,
too – two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town
the morning after the murder, and told about it, and
was out with ’em on the ferryboat hunt, and right
away after he up and left. Before night they wanted
to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next
day they found out the nigger was gone; they found
out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clock the night
the murder was done. So then they put it on him,
you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back
comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge
Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over
Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that
evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight
with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers,
and then went off with them. Well, he hain’t come
back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till
this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now
that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would
think robbers done it, and then he’d get Huck’s
money without having to bother a long time with a
lawsuit. People do say he warn’t any too good to do
it. Oh, he’s sly, I reckon. If he don’t come back for a
year he’ll be all right. You can’t prove anything on
him, you know; everything will be quieted down then,
and he’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”

“Yes, I reckon so, ’m. I don’t see nothing in the
way of it. Has everybody quit thinking the nigger
done it?”

“Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he
done it. But they’ll get the nigger pretty soon now,
and maybe they can scare it out of him.”
