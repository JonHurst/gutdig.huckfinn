that glad to see me again he didn't know what to do.
And he wanted to know all about it right off, because
it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it
hit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone
till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we
drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a
fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?
He said, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb
him. So he thought and thought, and pretty soon
he says:

"It's all right; I've got it. Take my trunk in your
wagon, and let on it's your'n; and you turn back
and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about
the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a
piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter
or a half an hour after you; and you needn't let on to
know me at first."

I says:

"All right; but wait a minute. There's one more
thing--a thing that {{nobody}} don't know but me.
And that is, there's a nigger here that I'm a-trying
to steal out of slavery, and his name is {{Jim}}--old Miss
Watson's Jim."

He says:

"What! Why, Jim is--"

He stopped and went to studying. I says:

"{{I}} know what you'll say. You'll say it's dirty,
low-down business; but what if it is? {{I}}'m low down;
and I'm a-going to steal him, and I want you keep
mum and not let on. Will you?"

His eye lit up, and he says:

"I'll {{help}} you steal him!"
