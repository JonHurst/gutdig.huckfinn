ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.
Then we can snatch him out and rush him away
the first time there’s an alarm. Yes, I reckon that ’ll
be the best way.”

“Now, there’s {{sense}} in that,” I says. “Letting on
don’t cost nothing; letting on ain’t no trouble; and
if it’s any object, I don’t mind letting on we was at it
a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn’t strain me
none, after I got my hand in. So I’ll mosey along
now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.”

“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make
a saw out of.”

“Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest
it,” I says, “there’s an old rusty saw-blade around
yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind
the smokehouse.”

He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and
says:

“It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.
Run along and smouch the knives – three of them.”
So I done it.
