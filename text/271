and I won’t do so any more. You tell me what to do,
and whatever you say I’ll do it.”

“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two
frauds, and I’m fixed so I got to travel with them a
while longer, whether I want to or not – I druther not
tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this
town would get me out of their claws, and {{I}}’d be all
right; but there’d be another person that you don’t
know about who’d be in big trouble. Well, we got
to save {{him}}, hain’t we? Of course. Well, then, we
won’t blow on them.”

Saying them words put a good idea in my head. I
see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the
frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I
didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without
anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I
didn’t want the plan to begin working till pretty late
to-night. I says:

“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and
you won’t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long,
nuther. How fur is it?”

“A little short of four miles – right out in the
country, back here.”

“Well, that ’ll answer. Now you go along out
there, and lay low till nine or half past to-night, and
then get them to fetch you home again – tell them
you’ve thought of something. If you get here before
eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t
turn up wait {{till}} eleven, and {{then}} if I don’t turn up it
means I’m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then
you come out and spread the news around, and get
these beats jailed.”
