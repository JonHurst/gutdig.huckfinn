and horses, and they’d be along pretty soon and give
me ’bout half an hour’s start, and then run me down
if they could; and if they got me they’d tar and
feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn’t
wait for no breakfast – I warn’t hungry.”

“Old man,” said the young one, “I reckon we
might double-team it together; what do you think?”

“I ain’t undisposed. What’s your line – mainly?”

“Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent
medicines; theater-actor – tragedy, you know; take
a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there’s
a chance; teach singing-geography school for a
change; sling a lecture sometimes – oh, I do lots of
things – most anything that comes handy, so it ain’t
work. What’s your lay?”

“I’ve done considerble in the doctoring way in
my time. Layin’ on o’ hands is my best holt – for
cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I k’n tell
a fortune pretty good when I’ve got somebody along
to find out the facts for me. Preachin’s my line,
too, and workin’ camp-meetin’s, and missionaryin’
around.”

Nobody never said anything for a while; then the
young man hove a sigh and says:

“Alas!”

“What ’re you alassin’ about?” says the baldhead.

“To think I should have lived to be leading such
a life, and be degraded down into such company.”
And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with
a rag.

“Dern your skin, ain’t the company good enough
for you?” says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.
