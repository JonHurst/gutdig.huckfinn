So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn’t
look around, but I kinder felt like he was watching
me. But I knowed I could tire him out at that. I
went straight out in the country as much as a mile
before I stopped; then I doubled back through the
woods towards Phelps’s. I reckoned I better start in
on my plan straight off without fooling around, because
I wanted to stop Jim’s mouth till these fellows
could get away. I didn’t want no trouble with their
kind. I’d seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted
to get entirely shut of them.
