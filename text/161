“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”

“I reckon he {{warn’t}} a coward. Not by a blame’
sight. There ain’t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons – not
a one. And there ain’t no cowards
amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old
man kep’ up his end in a fight one day for half an
hour against three Grangerfords, and come out
winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his
horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep’ his
horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords
stayed on their horses and capered around
the old man, and peppered away at him, and he
peppered away at them. Him and his horse both
went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the
Grangerfords had to be {{fetched}} home – and one of
’em was dead, and another died the next day. No,
sir; if a body’s out hunting for cowards he don’t want
to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons,
becuz they don’t breed any of that {{kind}}.”

Next Sunday we all went to church, about three
mile, everybody a-horseback. The men took their
guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their
knees or stood them handy against the wall. The
Shepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery
preaching – all about brotherly love, and such-like
tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon,
and they all talked it over going home, and had
such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works
and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don’t
know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the
roughest Sundays I had run across yet.

About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing
