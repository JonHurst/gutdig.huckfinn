little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes
just a narrow channel between, and some
that I couldn't see I knowed was there because I'd
hear the wash of the current against the old dead
brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well,
I warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst the
towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little
while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a

I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag,
maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and
tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't
bother no more. I didn't want to go to sleep, of

to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.

It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest
and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just
