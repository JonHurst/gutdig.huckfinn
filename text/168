I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see
them, and jumped on their horses and took out
after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn't
do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got
to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and
slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on
the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the
other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.

The men ripped around awhile, and then rode
away. As soon as they was out of sight I sung out
to Buck and told him. He didn't know what to
make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.
He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out

be gone long. I wished I was out of
that tree, but I dasn't come down. Buck begun to
cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and his cousin Joe
(that was the other young chap) would make up for
this day yet. He said his father and his two brothers
was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the
Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said
his father and brothers ought to waited for their
relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for
them. I asked him what was become of young
Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they'd got across
the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the

kill Harney that day he shot at him--I hain't ever
heard anything like it.

All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three
or four guns--the men had slipped around through
