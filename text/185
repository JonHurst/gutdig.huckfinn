Well, for the next day or two we had considerable
trouble, because people was always coming out in
skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying
they believed he was a runaway nigger. We don't
run daytimes no more now; nights they don't bother
us."

The duke says:

"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can
run in the daytime if we want to. I'll think the thing
over--I'll invent a plan that 'll fix it. We'll let it
alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to
go by that town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be
healthy."

Towards night it begun to darken up and look like
rain; the heat-lightning was squirting around low
down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to
shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy
to see that. So the duke and the king went to overhauling
our wigwam, to see what the beds was like.
My bed was a straw tick--better than Jim's, which
was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around
about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and
hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound
like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it
makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the
duke allowed he would take my bed; but the king
allowed he wouldn't. He says:

"I should 'a' reckoned the difference in rank would
a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn't just
fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace 'll take the
shuck bed yourself."

Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute,
