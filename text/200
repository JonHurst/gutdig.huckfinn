seemed like he was just born for it; and when he had
his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely
the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind
when he was getting it off.

The first chance we got the duke he had some
show-bills printed; and after that, for two or three
days as we floated along, the raft was a most uncommon
lively place, for there warn’t nothing but sword-fighting
and rehearsing – as the duke called it – going
on all the time. One morning, when we was pretty
well down the state of Arkansaw, we come in sight
of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up
about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth
of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress
trees, and all of us but Jim took the canoe and
went down there to see if there was any chance in
that place for our show.

We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be
a circus there that afternoon, and the country-people
was already beginning to come in, in all kinds of old
shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would
leave before night, so our show would have a pretty
good chance. The duke he hired the court-house, and
we went around and stuck up our bills. They read
like this:
