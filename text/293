The minute I was far enough above the town to see
I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for
a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning
showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and
shoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with
nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big
distance off, away out there in the middle of the river,
but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the raft
at last I was so fagged I would ’a’ just laid down to
blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn’t.
As I sprung aboard I sung out:

“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be
to goodness, we’re shut of them!”

Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms
spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed
him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth
and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was
old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it
most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim
fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me,
and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was
shut of the king and the duke, but I says:

“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!
Cut loose and let her slide!”

So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the
river, and it {{did}} seem so good to be free again and all
by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to bother
us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and
crack my heels a few times – I couldn’t help it; but
about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed
mighty well, and held my breath and listened and
waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted
