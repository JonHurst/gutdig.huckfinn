cheap. I could ’a’ stayed if I wanted to, but
I didn’t want to.

I went to the circus and loafed around the back
side till the watchman went by, and then dived in
under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold piece

and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like
a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in
clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered

see anything so lovely. And then one by one they
got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the
ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking
ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads
bobbing and skimming along, away up there under
the tent-roof, and every lady’s rose-leafy dress flapping
soft and silky around her hips, and she looking
like the most loveliest parasol.
