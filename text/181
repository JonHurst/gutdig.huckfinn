“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation
sorry for you, but you ain’t the only person that’s
had troubles like that.”

“No?”

“No, you ain’t. You ain’t the only person that’s
ben snaked down wrongfully out’n a high place.”

“Alas!”

“No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a
secret of his birth.” And, by jings, {{he}} begins to
cry.

“Hold! What do you mean?”

“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man,
still sort of sobbing.

“To the bitter death!” He took the old man by
the hand and squeezed it, and says, “That secret
of your being: speak!”

“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”

You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then
the duke says:

“You are what?”

“Yes, my friend, it is too true – your eyes is
lookin’ at this very moment on the pore disappeared
Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the
Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”

“You! At your age! No! You mean you’re
the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven
hundred years old, at the very least.”

“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done
it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature
balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you,
in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled,
trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”
