has done generous by them that's left behind in the
vale of sorrers. He has done generous by these yer
poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and
that's left fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we
that knowed him knows that he would 'a' done {{more}}
generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin'
his dear William and me. Now, {{wouldn't}} he? Ther'
ain't no question 'bout it in {{my}} mind. Well, then,
what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in
his way at sech a time? And what kind o' uncles
would it be that 'd rob--yes, {{rob}}--sech poor sweet
lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time? If I
know William--and I {{think}} I do--he--well, I'll jest
ask him." He turns around and begins to make a
lot of signs to the duke with his hands, and the
duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed
awhile; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with
all his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen
times before he lets up. Then the king says, "I
knowed it; I reckon {{that}} 'll convince anybody the
way {{he}} feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan,
Joanner, take the money--take it {{all.}} It's the gift
of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful."

Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip
went for the duke, and then such another hugging and
kissing I never see yet. And everybody crowded up
with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands
off of them frauds, saying all the time:

"You {{dear}} good souls!--how {{lovely!}}--how {{could}}
you!"

Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking
