“Well, how’d the old thing pan out this time,
duke?” He hadn’t been up-town at all.

We never showed a light till we was about ten
mile below the village. Then we lit up and had a
supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed
their bones loose over the way they’d served them
people. The duke says:

“Greenhorns, flatheads! {{I}} knew the first house
would keep mum and let the rest of the town get
roped in; and I knew they’d lay for us the third
night, and consider it was {{their}} turn now. Well, it
{{is}} their turn, and I’d give something to know how
much they’d take for it. I {{would}} just like to know
how they’re putting in their opportunity. They can
turn it into a picnic if they want to – they brought
plenty provisions.”

Them rapscallions took in four hundred and
sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see
money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before.

By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim
says:

“Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries
on, Huck?”

“No,” I says, “it don’t.”

“Why don’t it, Huck?”

“Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed. I reckon
they’re all alike.”

“But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is reglar rapscallions;
dat’s jist what dey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.”

“Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is
mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.”

“Is dat so?”
