powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the
table and yells, and says:

“Gentlemen – gentle{{men!}} Hear me just a word – just
a {{single}} word – if you PLEASE! There’s one way
yet – let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.”

That took them.

“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right
off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out:

“Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and
the boy, and fetch {{them}} along, too!”

“We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t
find them marks we’ll lynch the whole gang!”

I {{was}} scared, now, I tell you. But there warn’t no
getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and
marched us right along, straight for the graveyard,
which was a mile and a half down the river, and the
whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough,
and it was only nine in the evening.

As we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent
Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip
her the wink she’d light out and save me, and blow on
our dead-beats.

Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just
carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary
the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning
to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most
dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned;
everything was going so different from what I had
allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my
own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have
Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free
