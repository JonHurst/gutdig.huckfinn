I found a tolerable good currycomb, and Jim he
found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.
The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it
was a good enough leg, though it was too long for
me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t
find the other one, though we hunted all around.

And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.
When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter
of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad
day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover
up with the quilt, because if he set up people could
tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over
to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half
a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under
the bank, and hadn’t no accidents and didn’t see
nobody. We got home all safe.
