hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a
friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the
morning."

"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't
have my love given to them."

"Well, then, it sha'n't be." It was well enough
to tell {{her}} so--no harm in it. It was only a little
thing to do, and no trouble; and it's the little things
