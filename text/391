of the river, but didn’t make no more noise than we
was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and
comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
we could hear them yelling and barking at each
other all up and down the bank, till we was so far
away the sounds got dim and died out. And when
we stepped onto the raft I says:

“{{Now}}, old Jim, you’re a free man {{again}}, and I
bet you won’t ever be a slave no more.”

“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It ’uz
planned beautiful, en it ’uz {{done}} beautiful; en dey
ain’t {{nobody}} kin git up a plan dat’s mo’ mixed up
en splendid den what dat one wuz.”

We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the
gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf
of his leg.

When me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel as
brash as what we did before. It was hurting him
considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the
wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to
bandage him, but he says:

“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don’t stop
now; don’t fool around here, and the evasion booming
along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her
loose! Boys, we done it elegant! – ‘deed we did. I
wish {{we’d}} ’a’ had the handling of Louis XVI., there
wouldn’t ’a’ been no ‘Son of Saint Louis, ascend to
heaven!’ wrote down in {{his}} biography; no, sir, we’d
’a’ whooped him over the {{border}} – that’s what we’d
’a’ done with {{him}} – and done it just as slick as
nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps – man the
sweeps!”
