of fooling them away like that. And what’s more – if
I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho
before I would drop my business and come to him
for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”

“How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you’d {{have}} to
come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to
or not.”

“What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a
church? All right, then; I {{would}} come; but I lay
I’d make that man climb the highest tree there
was in the country.”

“Shucks, it ain’t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.
You don’t seem to know anything, somehow – perfect
saphead.”

I thought all this over for two or three days, and
then I reckoned I would see if there was anything
in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and
went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till
I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace
and sell it; but it warn’t no use, none of the genies
come. So then I judged that all that stuff was only
just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies. I reckoned he
believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as
for me I think different. It had all the marks of a
Sunday-school.
