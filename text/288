either of ’em Wilkses” – and he wagged his head
towards the king and the duke.

Well, what do you think? That mule-headed old
fool wouldn’t give in {{then!}} Indeed he wouldn’t.
Said it warn’t no fair test. Said his brother William
was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t {{tried}}
to write – {{he}} see William was going to play one of his
jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he
warmed up and went warbling right along till he was
actuly beginning to believe what he was saying {{himself}};
but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and
says:

“I’ve thought of something. Is there anybody
here that helped to lay out my br – helped to lay out
the late Peter Wilks for burying?”

“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done
it. We’re both here.”

Then the old man turns toward the king, and
says:

“Peraps this gentleman can tell me what was
tattooed on his breast?”

Blamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty
quick, or he’d ’a’ squshed down like a bluff bank that
the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and,
mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make
most {{anybody}} sqush to get fetched such a solid one as
that without any notice, because how was {{he}} going to
know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a
little; he couldn’t help it; and it was mighty still in
there, and everybody bending a little forwards and
gazing at him. Says I to myself, {{Now}} he’ll throw up
the sponge – there ain’t no more use. Well, did he?
