was free and safe once more. I hadn’t had a bite
to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers
and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and
greens – there ain’t nothing in the world so good
when it’s cooked right – and whilst I eat my supper
we talked and had a good time. I was powerful glad
to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get
away from the swamp. We said there warn’t no
home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so
cramped up and smothery, but a raft don’t. You
feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.
