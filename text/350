nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole
there, because Jim's counterpin hung down most to
the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look

dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you
couldn't see we'd done anything hardly. At last

"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work.
If we was prisoners it would, because then we'd have
as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we
