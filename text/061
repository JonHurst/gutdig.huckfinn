I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for
me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke.
So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and
listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide
there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so
I was having a good enough time seeing them
hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat.
Well, then I happened to think how they always put
quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because
they always go right to the drownded carcass
and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and
if any of them's floating around after me I'll give
them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the
island to see what luck I could have, and I warn't
disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I
most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and
she floated out further. Of course I was where the
current set in the closest to the shore--I knowed
enough for that. But by and by along comes another
one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and
shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my
teeth in. It was "baker's bread"--what the quality
eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.

I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there
on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat,
and very well satisfied. And then something
struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the
parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find
me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain't
no doubt but there is something in that thing--that
is, there's something in it when a body like the
widow or the parson prays, but it don't work for
