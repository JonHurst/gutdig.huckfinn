washes off down the river. See? He’ll be drownded,
and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own
self. I reckon that’s a considerable sight better ’n
killin’ of him. I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as
long as you can git aroun’ it; it ain’t good sense, it
ain’t good morals. Ain’t I right?”

“Yes, I reck’n you are. But s’pose she {{don’t}}
break up and wash off?”

“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and
see, can’t we?”

“All right, then; come along.”

So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat,
and scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there;
but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “Jim!” and
he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
moan, and I says:

“Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around
and moaning; there’s a gang of murderers in yonder,
and if we don’t hunt up their boat and set her
drifting down the river so these fellows can’t get
away from the wreck there’s one of ’em going to be
in a bad fix. But if we find their boat we can put
{{all}} of ’em in a bad fix – for the sheriff ’ll get ’em.
Quick – hurry! I’ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt
the stabboard. You start at the raft, and – ”

“Oh, my lordy, lordy! {{Raf’?}} Dey ain’ no raf’
no mo’; she done broke loose en gone! – en here
we is!”
