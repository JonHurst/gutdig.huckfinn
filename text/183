grub and an easy life--come, give us your
hand, duke, and le's all be friends."

The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad
to see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness
and we felt mighty good over it, because it would 'a'
been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness
on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on
a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right
and kind towards the others.

It didn't take me long to make up my mind that
these liars warn't no kings nor dukes at all, but just
low-down humbugs and frauds. But I never said
nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best
way; then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get
into no trouble. If they wanted us to call them
kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as it
would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no
use to tell Jim, so I didn't tell him. If I never
learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best
way to get along with his kind of people is to let
them have their own way.
