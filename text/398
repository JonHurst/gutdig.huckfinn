a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how {{did}}
they git that grindstone in there? s'I. Without {{help,}}
mind you--'thout {{help! Thar's}} where 'tis. Don't
tell {{me,}} s'I; there {{wuz}} help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a {{plenty}}
help, too, s'I; ther's ben a {{dozen}} a-helpin' that nigger,
'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on this place but
{{I'd}} find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I--"

"A {{dozen}} says you!--{{forty}} couldn't 'a' done everything
