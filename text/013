and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared
and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up
and turned around in my tracks three times and
crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a
little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches
away. But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that
when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you’ve found,
instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t
ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off
bad luck when you’d killed a spider.

I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out
my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as
death now, and so the widow wouldn’t know. Well,
after a long time I heard the clock away off in the
town go boom – boom – boom – twelve licks; and
all still again – stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard
a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees – something
was a-stirring. I set still and listened.
Directly I could just barely hear a “{{me-yow! me-yow!}}”
down there. That was good! Says I, “{{me-yow!
me-yow!}}” as soft as I could, and then I put
out the light and scrambled out of the window on to
the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and
crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there
was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
