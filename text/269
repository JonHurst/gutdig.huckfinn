and told me to say it {{again}}, say it {{again}}, say it {{again!}}

I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much,
and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think
a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited
and handsome, but looking kind of happy and
eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.
So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I

"Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?"

"Never mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I know

weeks--here in this house--and {{prove}} how I know
it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?"

"Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"

"All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more
out of {{you}} than just your word--I druther have it
