blame on account of the rats. But never mind--let
it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good."

And so he went on a-mumbling up-stairs, and then
we left. He was a mighty nice old man. And
always is.

Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do
for a spoon, but he said we'd got to have it; so he
took a think. When he had ciphered it out he told
me how we was to do; then we went and waited
around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally
coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons
and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of
them up my sleeve, and Tom says:

"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons
{{yet}}."

She says:

"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I
know better, I counted 'm myself."

"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and {{I}}
can't make but nine."

She looked out of all patience, but of course she
come to count--anybody would.

"I declare to gracious ther' {{ain't}} but nine!" she
says. "Why, what in the world--plague {{take}} the
things, I'll count 'm again."

So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got
done counting, she says:

"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's {{ten}} now!"
and she looked huffy and bothered both. But Tom
says:

"Why, Aunty, {{I}} don't think there's ten."

"You numskull, didn't you see me {{count}} 'm?"
