come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore,
but I couldn’t see no way out of the trouble. After
all this long journey, and after all we’d done for them
scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything
all busted up and ruined, because they could
have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and
make him a slave again all his life, and amongst
strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.

Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times
better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family
was, as long as he’d {{got}} to be a slave, and so I’d better
write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell
Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that
notion for two things: she’d be mad and disgusted
at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her,
and so she’d sell him straight down the river again;
and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an
ungrateful nigger, and they’d make Jim feel it all
the time, and so he’d feel ornery and disgraced. And
then think of {{me!}} It would get all around that Huck
Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I
was ever to see anybody from that town again I’d
be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame.
That’s just the way: a person does a low-down thing,
and then he don’t want to take no consequences of it.
Thinks as long as he can hide, it ain’t no disgrace.
That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about
this the more my conscience went to grinding me,
and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I
got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a
sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence
slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness
