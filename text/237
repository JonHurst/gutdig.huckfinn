coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then him
and the duke, with a hand across each other’s shoulder,
and t’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and
solemn over there, everybody dropping back to
give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,
people saying “’Sh!” and all the men taking their
hats off and drooping their heads, so you could ’a’
heard a pin fall. And when they got there they
bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one
sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could
’a’ heard them to Orleans, most; and then they put
their arms around each other’s necks, and hung
their chins over each other’s shoulders; and then for
three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men
leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody
was doing the same; and the place was that damp
I never see anything like it. Then one of them got
on one side of the coffin, and t’other on t’other side,
and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads
on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.
Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like
you never see anything like it, and everybody broke
down and went to sobbing right out loud – the poor
girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the
girls, without saying a word, and kissed them,
solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with
the tears running down, and then busted out and
went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next
woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.

Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes
forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers
