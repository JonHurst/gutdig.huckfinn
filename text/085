know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practised
around all day to get the hang of the things, and
by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim
said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said I must
quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.
I took notice, and done better.

I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just
after dark.

I started across to the town from a little below
the ferry-landing, and the drift of the current fetched
me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and
started along the bank. There was a light burning
in a little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long
time, and I wondered who had took up quarters
there. I slipped up and peeped in at the window.
There was a woman about forty year old in there
knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I
didn't know her face; she was a stranger, for you
couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.
Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I
was getting afraid I had come; people might know
my voice and find me out. But if this woman had
been in such a little town two days she could tell
me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door,
and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I was a girl.
