Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim
didn’t know hardly what to do, we was so sorry – and
so glad and proud we’d got him with us, too.
So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and
tried to comfort {{him.}} But he said it warn’t no use,
nothing but to be dead and done with it all could
do him any good; though he said it often made him
feel easier and better for a while if people treated him
according to his rights, and got down on one knee
to speak to him, and always called him “Your

didn’t set down in his presence till he asked them.
So Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this
and that and t’other for him, and standing up till
he told us we might set down. This done him heaps
of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable.
But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn’t look
a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,
the king acted real friendly towards him, and said
the duke’s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes
of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by {{his}}
father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable;
but the duke stayed huffy a good while,
till by and by the king says:

“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long
time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s
the use o’ your bein’ sour? It ’ll only make things
oncomfortable. It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a
duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king – so
what’s the use to worry? Make the best o’ things
the way you find ’em, says I – that’s my motto.
This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here – plenty
