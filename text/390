and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file,
and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but
Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had
to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made
a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started
somebody sings out:

"Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!"

But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels
and shoved. Then there was a rush, and a {{bang,}}
{{bang,}} {{bang!}} and the bullets fairly whizzed around us!
We heard them sing out:

"Here they are! They've broke for the river!
After 'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!"

So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them
because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn't
wear no boots and didn't yell. We was in the path
to the mill; and when they got pretty close onto us
we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and
then dropped in behind them. They'd had all the
dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers;
but by this time somebody had let them loose, and
here they come, making powwow enough for a
million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our
tracks till they catched up; and when they see it
warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer
them, they only just said howdy, and tore right
ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then
we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them
till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up
through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and
hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle
