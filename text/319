"Has he come?"

"No," says her husband.

"Good-{{ness}} gracious!" she says, "what in the
world {{can}} have become of him?"

"I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and
I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy."

"Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted!
He {{must}} 'a' come; and you've missed him along the
road. I {{know}} it's so--something {{tells}} me so."

"Why, Sally, I {{couldn't}} miss him along the road--{{you}}
know that."

"But oh, dear, dear, what {{will}} Sis say! He must
'a' come! You must 'a' missed him. He--"

"Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.
I don't know what in the world to make of
it. I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind acknowledging
't I'm right down scared. But there's no hope
that he's come; for he {{couldn't}} come and me miss
him. Sally, it's terrible--just terrible--something's
happened to the boat, sure!"

"Why, Silas! Look yonder!--up the road!--ain't
that somebody coming?"

He sprung to the window at the head of the bed,
and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted.
She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and
give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned
back from the window there she stood, a-beaming and
a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty
meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman
stared, and says:

"Why, who's that?"

"Who do you reckon 'tis?"
