"Oh," he says.

But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her,
and shook his head, and said he reckoned he'd look
around for a bigger one. But they was all locked
and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me
to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around
further, or maybe I better go down home and get
them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I
said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft,
and then he started.

I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself,
spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a
sheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n it takes him three
or four days? What are we going to do?--lay
around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?
No, sir; I know what {{I'll}} do. I'll wait, and when he
comes back if he says he's got to go any more I'll
get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and
tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river;
and when Tom's done with him we'll give him what
it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get ashore.

So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some
sleep; and next time I waked up the sun was away
up over my head! I shot out and went for the
doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in
the night some time or other, and warn't back yet.
Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and
I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I
shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed
my head into Uncle Silas's stomach! He says:

"Why, {{Tom!}} Where you been all this time, you
rascal?"
