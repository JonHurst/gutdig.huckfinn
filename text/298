hide it?”

The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he
says:

“Well, I don’t care if I {{did}}, I didn’t {{do}} it, anyway.
But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you

wanted to get what money I’d got out of the ‘None-such’
and one thing or another, and scoop it {{all!}}”

The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
