while Buck was telling his tale, and her nostrils
spread and her eyes snapped. The two young men
looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia
she turned pale, but the color come back when she
found the man warn’t hurt.

Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs
under the trees by ourselves, I says:

“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”

“Well, I bet I did.”

“What did he do to you?”

“Him? He never done nothing to me.”

“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”

“Why, nothing – only it’s on account of the feud.”

“What’s a feud?”

“Why, where was you raised? Don’t you know
what a feud is?”

“Never heard of it before – tell me about it.”

“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way: A man
has a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then
that other man’s brother kills {{him}}; then the other
brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then
the {{cousins}} chip in – and by and by everybody’s
killed off, and there ain’t no more feud. But it’s
kind of slow, and takes a long time.”

“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”

“Well, I should {{reckon!}} It started thirty year
ago, or som’ers along there. There was trouble
’bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and
the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and
shot the man that won the suit – which he would
naturally do, of course. Anybody would.”

“What was the trouble about, Buck? – land?”
