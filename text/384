I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but
stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not
blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip
there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Donâ€™t
do anything but just the way I am telling you; if you do they will
suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish
any reward but to know I have done the right thing.
UNKNOWN FRIEND.
