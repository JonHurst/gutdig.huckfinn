it pinched. Conscience says to me, “What had poor
Miss Watson done to you that you could see her
nigger go off right under your eyes and never say
one single word? What did that poor old woman
do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why,
she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn
you your manners, she tried to be good to you every
way she knowed how. {{That’s}} what she done.”

I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most
wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft,
abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up
and down past me. We neither of us could keep
still. Every time he danced around and says,
“Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me like a shot, and
I thought if it {{was}} Cairo I reckoned I would die of
miserableness.

Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking
to myself. He was saying how the first thing he
would do when he got to a free state he would go to
saving up money and never spend a single cent, and
when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was
owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived;
and then they would both work to buy the two children,
and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d
get an Ab’litionist to go and steal them.

It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn’t
ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just
see what a difference it made in him the minute he
judged he was about free. It was according to the old
saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.”
Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking.
Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped
