CHAPTER XX

They asked us considerable many questions;
wanted to know what we covered up the raft
that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of
running – was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I:

“Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run
{{south?}}”

No, they allowed he wouldn’t. I had to account
for things some way, so I says:

“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri,
where I was born, and they all died off but me and pa
and my brother Ike. Pa, he ’lowed he’d break up
and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s got a
little one-horse place on the river forty-four mile
below Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had some
debts; so when he’d squared up there warn’t nothing
left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That
warn’t enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck
passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose
pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece
of a raft; so we reckoned we’d go down to Orleans on
it. Pa’s luck didn’t hold out; a steamboat run over
the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all
went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and
me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was
only four years old, so they never come up no more.
