"So they always acquit; and then a {{man}} goes in
the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his
back, and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that
you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake,
and the other is that you didn't come in the dark
and fetch your masks. You brought {{part}} of a man--Buck
Harkness, there--and if you hadn't had him
to start you, you'd 'a' taken it out in blowing.

"You didn't want to come. The average man
don't like trouble and danger. {{You}} don't like trouble
and danger. But if only {{half}} a man--like Buck
Harkness, there--shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!'
you're afraid to back down--afraid you'll be found
out to be what you are--{{cowards}}--and so you raise
a yell, and hang yourselves onto that half-a-man's
coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big
things you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is
a mob; that's what an army is--a mob; they don't fight
with courage that's born in them, but with courage
that's borrowed from their mass, and from their
officers. But a mob without any {{man}} at the head of
it is {{beneath}} pitifulness. Now the thing for {{you}} to do
is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a
hole. If any real lynching's going to be done it will
be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they
come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a {{man}} along.
Now {{leave}}--and take your half-a-man with you"--tossing
his gun up across his left arm and cocking it
when he says this.

The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke
all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and
Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable
