to know the news. Tell him I’ll have his niece all
safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself,
now; I’m a-going up around the corner here to roust
out my engineer.”

I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the
corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed
her out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water
about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in
among some wood-boats; for I couldn’t rest easy till
I could see the ferryboat start. But take it all
around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts
of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not
many would ’a’ done it. I wished the widow knowed
about it. I judged she would be proud of me for
helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and
dead-beats is the kind the widow and good people
takes the most interest in.

Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and
dusky, sliding along down! A kind of cold shiver
went through me, and then I struck out for her.
She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t
much chance for anybody being alive in her. I
pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there
wasn’t any answer; all dead still. I felt a little bit
heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for
I reckoned if they could stand it I could.

Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the
middle of the river on a long down-stream slant; and
when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my
oars, and looked back and see her go and smell
around the wreck for Miss Hooker’s remainders,
because the captain would know her uncle Hornback
