CHAPTER XXXIV

We stopped talking, and got to thinking. By
and by Tom says:

"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not
think of it before! I bet I know where Jim is."

"No! Where?"

"In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why,
looky here. When we was at dinner, didn't you see
a nigger man go in there with some vittles?"

"Yes."

"What did you think the vittles was for?"

"For a dog."

"So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."

"Why?"

"Because part of it was watermelon."

"So it was--I noticed it. Well, it does beat all
that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon.
It shows how a body can see and don't see
at the same time."

"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he
went in, and he locked it again when he came out.
He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from table--same key, I bet. Watermelon shows
man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's
two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where
the people's all so kind and good. Jim's the prisoner.
