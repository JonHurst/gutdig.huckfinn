CHAPTER XLI

The doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking
old man when I got him up. I told him
me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting
yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of
a raft we found, and about midnight he must 'a'
kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot
him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there
and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody
know, because we wanted to come home this
evening and surprise the folks.

"Who is your folks?" he says.

"The Phelpses, down yonder."

"Oh," he says. And after a minute, he says:

"How'd you say he got shot?"

"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."

"Singular dream," he says.

So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags,
and we started. But when he see the canoe he
didn't like the look of her--said she was big enough
for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says:

"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the
three of us easy enough."

"What three?"

"Why, me and Sid, and--and--and {{the guns}};
that's what I mean."
