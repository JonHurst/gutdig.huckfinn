do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyards
and the sawmill.

I went along up the bank with one eye out for
pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch
along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just
a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long,
riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the
bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out
for the canoe. I just expected there'd be somebody
laying down in it, because people often done that
to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff
out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him.
But it warn't so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure

Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she's
worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore
pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running her into
a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines
and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I'd hide
her good, and then, 'stead of taking to the woods
when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty
mile and camp in one place for good, and not have
such a rough time tramping on foot.

It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought
I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got
her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch
of willows, and there was the old man down the
path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his
gun. So he hadn't seen anything.

When he got along I was hard at it taking up a
"trot" line. He abused me a little for being so
slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was
