days. If you’ll promise you won’t blow, and won’t
let the nigger blow, I’ll tell you where to find him.”

So I promised, and he says:

“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph – ” and then
he stopped. You see, he started to tell me the
truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to
study and think again, I reckoned he was changing
his mind. And so he was. He wouldn’t trust me;
he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way
the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:

“The man that bought him is named Abram
Foster – Abram G. Foster – and he lives forty mile
back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”

“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.
And I’ll start this very afternoon.”

“No you won’t, you’ll start {{now}}; and don’t you
lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling
by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head
and move right along, and then you won’t get into
trouble with {{us}}, d’ye hear?”

That was the order I wanted, and that was the one
I played for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans.

“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr.
Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get
him to believe that Jim {{is}} your nigger – some idiots
don’t require documents – leastways I’ve heard
there’s such down South here. And when you tell
him the handbill and the reward’s bogus, maybe he’ll
believe you when you explain to him what the idea
was for getting ’em out. Go ’long now, and tell him
anything you want to; but mind you don’t work your
jaw any {{between}} here and there.”
