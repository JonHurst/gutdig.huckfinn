hanging around each other's necks and crying; and
I reckon I couldn't 'a' stood it all, but would 'a' had
to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed
the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be
back home in a week or two.

The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a
good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous
to separate the mother and the children that
way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool
he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say
or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.

Next day was auction day. About broad day in
the morning the king and the duke come up in the
garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that
there was trouble. The king says:

"Was you in my room night before last?"

"No, your majesty"--which was the way I always
called him when nobody but our gang warn't
around.

"Was you in there yisterday er last night?"

"No, your majesty."

"Honor bright, now--no lies."

"Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the
truth. I hain't been a-near your room since Miss
Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to
you."

The duke says:

"Have you seen anybody else go in there?"

"No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe."

"Stop and think."

I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:

"Well, I see the niggers go in there several times."
