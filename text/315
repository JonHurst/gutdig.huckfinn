sailing over fences and around corners from every-
wheres.

A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen
with a rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, “Begone!
{{you}} Tige! you Spot! begone sah!” and she fetched
first one and then another of them a clip and sent
them howling, and then the rest followed; and the
next second half of them come back, wagging their
tails around me, and making friends with me. There
ain’t no harm in a hound, nohow.

And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl
and two little nigger boys without anything on but
tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother’s
gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful,
the way they always do. And here comes the white
woman running from the house, about forty-five or
fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in
her hand; and behind her comes her little white
children, acting the same way the little niggers was
going. She was smiling all over so she could hardly
stand – and says:

“It’s {{you}}, at last! – {{ain’t}} it?”

I out with a “Yes’m” before I thought.

She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then
gripped me by both hands and shook and shook; and
the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and
she couldn’t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept
saying, “You don’t look as much like your mother
as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don’t
care for that, I’m {{so}} glad to see you! Dear, dear, it
does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it’s
your cousin Tom! – tell him howdy.”
