that’s started in on a new life, and’ll die before he’ll
go back. You mark them words – don’t forget I said
them. It’s a clean hand now; shake it – don’t be
afeard.”

So they shook it, one after the other, all around,
and cried. The judge’s wife she kissed it. Then the
old man he signed a pledge – made his mark. The
judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
like that. Then they tucked the old man into
a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in
the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a
stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod,
and clumb back again and had a good old time;
and toward daylight he crawled out again, drunk as
a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left
arm in two places, and was most froze to death when
somebody found him after sun-up. And when they
come to look at that spare room they had to take
soundings before they could navigate it.

The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned
a body could reform the old man with a shotgun,
maybe, but he didn’t know no other way.
