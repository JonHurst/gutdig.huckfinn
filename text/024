must help other people, and do everything I could for
other people, and look out for them all the time, and
never think about myself. This was including Miss
Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and
turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t
see no advantage about it – except for the other people;
so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about it
any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow
would take me one side and talk about Providence in
a way to make a body’s mouth water; but maybe
next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it
all down again. I judged I could see that there was
two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable
show with the widow’s Providence, but if
Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help for him
any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I
would belong to the widow’s if he wanted me, though
I couldn’t make out how he was a-going to be any
better off then than what he was before, seeing I was
so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.

Pap he hadn’t been seen for more than a year, and
that was comfortable for me; I didn’t want to see him
no more. He used to always whale me when he was
sober and could get his hands on me; though I used
to take to the woods most of the time when he was
around. Well, about this time he was found in the
river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said
this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged,
and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap;
but they couldn’t make nothing out of the face, because
it had been in the water so long it warn’t much
