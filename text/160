“I reckon maybe – I don’t know.”

“Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford
or a Shepherdson?”

“Laws, how do {{I}} know? It was so long ago.”

“Don’t anybody know?”

“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the
other old people; but they don’t know now what the
row was about in the first place.”

“Has there been many killed, Buck?”

“Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But they
don’t always kill. Pa’s got a few buckshot in him;
but he don’t mind it ’cuz he don’t weigh much,
anyway. Bob’s been carved up some with a bowie,
and Tom’s been hurt once or twice.”

“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”

“Yes; we got one and they got one. ’Bout three
months ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was
riding through the woods on t’other side of the
river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which
was blame’ foolishness, and in a lonesome place he
hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old
Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after him with his gun
in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind;
and ’stead of jumping off and taking to the brush,
Bud ’lowed he could outrun him; so they had it,
nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man
a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t
any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to
have the bullet-holes in front, you know, and the
old man he rode up and shot him down. But he
didn’t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside
of a week our folks laid {{him}} out.”
