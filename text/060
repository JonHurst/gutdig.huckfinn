CHAPTER VIII

The sun was up so high when I waked that I
judged it was after eight o’clock. I laid there
in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things,
and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.
I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but
mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there
amongst them. There was freckled places on the
ground where the light sifted down through the
leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little,
showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple
of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very
friendly.

I was powerful lazy and comfortable – didn’t want
to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off
again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of “boom!”
away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my
elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I
hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in
the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on
the water a long ways up – about abreast the ferry.
And there was the ferryboat full of people floating
along down. I knowed what was the matter now.
“Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the
ferryboat’s side. You see, they was firing cannon
over the water, trying to make my carcass come to
the top.
