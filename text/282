very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my
brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke his
arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here

one was a big rough husky that come along and
listened to all the old gentlemen said, and was listening
to the king now. And when the king got done
this husky up and says:
