steal it some way that they won't suspicion that I
done it. They've got a good thing here, and they
ain't a-going to leave till they've played this family
and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a
chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and
by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write

when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of
natural to hide under the bed when you are up to
anything private. They sets down then, and the
king says:
