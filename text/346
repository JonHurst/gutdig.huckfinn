crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to
get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and so, as
long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a
perfect right to steal anything on this place we had
the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with.
He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very
different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person
would steal when he warn’t a prisoner. So we
allowed we would steal everything there was that
come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one
day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the
nigger patch and eat it; and he made me go and give
the niggers a dime without telling them what it was
for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could
steal anything we {{needed.}} Well, I says, I needed the
watermelon. But he said I didn’t need it to get out
of prison with; there’s where the difference was.
He said if I’d ’a’ wanted it to hide a knife in, and
smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would
’a’ been all right. So I let it go at that, though I
couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a
prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot
of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a
chance to hog a watermelon.

Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till
everybody was settled down to business, and nobody
in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the
sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep
watch. By and by he come out, and we went and set
down on the woodpile to talk. He says:

“Everything’s all right now except tools; and
that’s easy fixed.”
