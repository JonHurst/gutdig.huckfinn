CHAPTER XXX

When they got aboard the king went for me,
and shook me by the collar, and says:

"Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!
Tired of our company, hey?"

I says:

"No, your majesty, we warn't--{{please}} don't, your
majesty!"

"Quick, then, and tell us what {{was}} your idea, or
I'll shake the insides out o' you!"

"Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened,
your majesty. The man that had a-holt of me
was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy
about as big as me that died last year, and he was
sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when
they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and
made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers,
'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I
lit out. It didn't seem no good for {{me}} to stay--{{I}}
couldn't do nothing, and I didn't want to be {{hung}} if
I could get away. So I never stopped running till I
found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to
hurry, or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said
I was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now, and
I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad
when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't."
