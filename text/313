CHAPTER XXXII

When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like,
and hot and sunshiny; the hands was
gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it
seem so lonesome and like everybody’s dead and
gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the
leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel
like it’s spirits whispering – spirits that’s been dead
ever so many years – and you always think they’re
talking about {{you.}} As a general thing it makes a
body wish {{he}} was dead, too, and done with it all.

Phelps’s was one of these little one-horse cotton
plantations, and they all look alike. A rail fence
round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed
off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different
length, to climb over the fence with, and for the
women to stand on when they are going to jump
onto a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big
yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old
hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log house
for the white folks – hewed logs, with the chinks
stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes
been whitewashed some time or another;
round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed
passage joining it to the house; log smokehouse back
