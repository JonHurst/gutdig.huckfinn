me all about the good place. She said all a body
would have to do there was to go around all day long
with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't
think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if
she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she
said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about
that, because I wanted him and me to be together.

Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got
tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the
niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was
off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of
candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a
chair by the window and tried to think of something
cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so lonesome I
most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and
the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and
I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody
that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying
about somebody that was going to die; and the
wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I
couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the
cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the
woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost
makes when it wants to tell about something that's
on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so
can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that
way every night grieving. I got so downhearted
and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty
soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I
could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need
anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign
