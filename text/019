him these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs
in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen in these parts
for a year or more."

They talked it over, and they was going to rule me
out, because they said every boy must have a family
or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be fair and
square for the others. Well, nobody could think of
anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set
still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I
thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson--they
could kill her. Everybody said:

"Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come
in."

blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.

"Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of
business of this Gang?"

"Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.

"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle,

"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery;
it's burglary," says Tom Sawyer. "We ain't

some that you bring to the cave here, and
keep them till they're ransomed."

"Ransomed? What's that?"
