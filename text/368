CHAPTER XXXVIII

Making them pens was a distressid tough job,
and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription
was going to be the toughest of all. That's
the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the
wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he'd {{got}} to;
there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling
his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.

"Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at
Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why,
Huck, s'pose it {{is}} considerble trouble?--what you
going to do?--how you going to get around it?
Jim's {{got}} to do his inscription and coat of arms.
They all do."

Jim says:

"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm;
I hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you
knows I got to keep de journal on dat."

"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms
is very different."

"Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says
he ain't got no coat of arms, because he hain't."

"I reckon {{I}} knowed that," Tom says, "but you
bet he'll have one before he goes out of this--because
he's going out {{right}}, and there ain't going
to be no flaws in his record."
