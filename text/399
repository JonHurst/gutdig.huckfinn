reckon you’d {{think}} so if you’d ’a’ been in this house
for a while back. Why, they’ve stole everything
they could lay their hands on – and we a-watching
all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right
off o’ the line! and as for that sheet they made the
rag ladder out of, ther’ ain’t no telling how many
times they {{didn’t}} steal that; and flour, and candles,
and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan,

dogs right on their very heels at that very time!
I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever {{heard}} of.
Why, {{sperits}} couldn’t ’a’ done better and been no

well, them dogs never even got on the {{track}} of ’m once!
You explain {{that}} to me if you can! – {{any}} of you!”
