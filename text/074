Dey wuz a nigger name’ Bob, dat had ketched a

nigger say de bank’s busted. So dey didn’ none uv
us git no money.”

“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”

“Well, I ’uz gwyne to spen’ it, but I had a dream,
en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name’

one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he’s lucky,
dey say, en I see I warn’t lucky. De dream say let
Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’d make a raise for
me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he
wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever
give to de po’ len’ to de Lord, en boun’ to git his
money back a hund’d times. So Balum he tuck en
give de ten cents to de po’, en laid low to see what

times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten {{cents}}
back, I’d call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.”

“Well, it’s all right anyway, Jim, long as you’re
going to be rich again some time or other.”

“Yes; en I’s rich now, come to look at it. I owns
mysef, en I’s wuth eight hund’d dollars. I wisht I
