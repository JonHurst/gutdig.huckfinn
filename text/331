world. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human
beings {{can}} be awful cruel to one another.

We see we was too late--couldn't do no good.
We asked some stragglers about it, and they said
everybody went to the show looking very innocent;
and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was
in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then
somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and
went for them.

So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling
so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and
humble, and to blame, somehow--though {{I}} hadn't
done nothing. But that's always the way; it don't
make no difference whether you do right or wrong,
a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just
goes for him {{anyway.}} If I had a yaller dog that
didn't know no more than a person's conscience does
I would pison him. It takes up more room than
all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no
good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.
