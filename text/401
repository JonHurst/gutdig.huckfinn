I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe
it was all right enough anyway, and about what a
body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty
harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as
long as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she
better put in her time being grateful we was alive
and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over
what was past and done. So then she kissed me,
and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind
of a brown-study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:

"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not
come yet! What {{has}} become of that boy?"

I see my chance; so I skips up and says:

"I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.

"No you won't," she says. "You'll stay right
wher' you are; {{one's}} enough to be lost at a time. If
he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll go."

Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after
supper uncle went.

He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't
run across Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good {{deal}}
uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no
occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'll
see this one turn up in the morning all sound and
right. So she had to be satisfied. But she said
she'd set up for him awhile anyway, and keep a light
burning so he could see it.

And then when I went up to bed she come up with
me and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, and
mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn't
look her in the face; and she set down on the bed
