if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two
hundred! If we could put it off till – ”

“Hurry! {{hurry!}}” I says. “Where’s Jim?”

“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm
you can touch him. He’s dressed, and everything’s
ready. Now we’ll slide out and give the sheep-
signal.”

But then we heard the tramp of men coming to
the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the
padlock, and heard a man say:

“I {{told}} you we’d be too soon; they haven’t come – the
door is locked. Here, I’ll lock some of you
into the cabin, and you lay for ’em in the dark
and kill ’em when they come; and the rest scatter
around a piece, and listen if you can hear ’em
coming.”

So in they come, but couldn’t see us in the dark,
and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get
under the bed. But we got under all right, and out
through the hole, swift but soft – Jim first, me next,
and Tom last, which was according to Tom’s orders.
Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings
close by outside. So we crept to the door, and Tom
stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but
couldn’t make out nothing, it was so dark; and
whispered and said he would listen for the steps to
get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide
out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack
and listened, and listened, and listened, and the
steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and
at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped
down, not breathing, and not making the least noise,
