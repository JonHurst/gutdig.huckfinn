I see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my
hand on it and said it. So then she looked a little
better satisfied, and says:

“Well, then, I’ll believe some of it; but I hope to
gracious if I’ll believe the rest.”

“What is it you won’t believe, Jo?” says Mary
Jane, stepping in with Susan behind her. “It ain’t
right nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him a
stranger and so far from his people. How would you
like to be treated so?”

“That’s always your way, Maim – always sailing
in to help somebody before they’re hurt. I hain’t
done nothing to him. He’s told some stretchers, I
reckon, and I said I wouldn’t swallow it all; and
that’s every bit and grain I {{did}} say. I reckon he can
stand a little thing like that, can’t he?”

“I don’t care whether ’twas little or whether ’twas
big; he’s here in our house and a stranger, and it
wasn’t good of you to say it. If you was in his place
it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn’t
to say a thing to another person that will make {{them}}
feel ashamed.”

“Why, Maim, he said – ”

“It don’t make no difference what he {{said}} – that
ain’t the thing. The thing is for you to treat him
{{kind,}} and not be saying things to make him remember
he ain’t in his own country and amongst his own
folks.”

I says to myself, {{this}} is a girl that I’m letting that
old reptile rob her of her money!

Then Susan {{she}} waltzed in; and if you’ll believe
me, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!
