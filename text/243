about the diseased again, and how good he was, and
what a loss he was, and all that; and before long a big
iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,
and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything;
and nobody saying anything to him either,
because the king was talking and they was all busy

done it the third time he says:

“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term,
because it ain’t – obsequies bein’ the common term – but
because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain’t
