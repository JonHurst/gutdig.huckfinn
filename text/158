Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same
steamboat-landing, which was about two mile above
our house; so sometimes when I went up there with
a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons
there on their fine horses.

One day Buck and me was away out in the woods
hunting, and heard a horse coming. We was crossing
the road. Buck says:

“Quick! Jump for the woods!”

We done it, and then peeped down the woods
through the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid young
man came galloping down the road, setting his
horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his
gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It
was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck’s
gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled off
from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight
to the place where we was hid. But we didn’t wait.
We started through the woods on a run. The woods
warn’t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge
the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with
his gun; and then he rode away the way he come – to
get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn’t see. We
never stopped running till we got home. The old
gentleman’s eyes blazed a minute – ’twas pleasure,
mainly, I judged – then his face sort of smoothed
down, and he says, kind of gentle:

“I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush.
Why didn’t you step into the road, my boy?”

“The Shepherdsons don’t, father. They always
take advantage.”
