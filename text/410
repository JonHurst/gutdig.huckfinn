a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of
them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she
says:

"{{Well}}, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it
{{now}}, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with
him again--"

"Meddling with {{who?}}" Tom says, dropping his
smile and looking surprised.

"With {{who?}} Why, the runaway nigger, of course.
Who'd you reckon?"

Tom looks at me very grave, and says:

"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right?
Hasn't he got away?"

"{{Him?}}" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger?
'Deed he hasn't. They've got him back, safe and
sound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread and
water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed
or sold!"

Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and
his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings
out to me:

"They hain't no {{right}} to shut him up! {{Shove!}}--and
don't you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he
ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur that walks
this earth!"

"What {{does}} the child mean?"

"I mean every word I {{say}}, Aunt Sally, and if somebody
don't go, {{I'll}} go. I've knowed him all his life,
and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died two
months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going
to sell him down the river, and {{said}} so; and she set
him free in her will."
