out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle, about
its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother
to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased
alive after the long journey of four thousand mile,
but it’s a trial that’s sweetened and sanctified to us
by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so
he thanks them out of his heart and out of his
brother’s heart, because out of their mouths they
can’t, words being too weak and cold, and all that
kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and
then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and
turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.

And the minute the words were out of his mouth
somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer,
and everybody joined in with all their might, and
it just warmed you up and made you feel as good
as church letting out. Music is a good thing; and
after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it
freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.

Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and
says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few
of the main principal friends of the family would
take supper here with them this evening, and help
set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if
his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows
who he would name, for they was names that was
very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters;
and so he will name the same, to wit, as follows,
viz.: – Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey,
and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and
Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and
the widow Bartley.
