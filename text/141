stayed under a minute and a half. Then I bounced
for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I
popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out
of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was
a booming current; and of course that boat started
her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them,
for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she
was churning along up the river, out of sight in the
thick weather, though I could hear her.

I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I
didn't get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that
touched me while I was "treading water," and struck
out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made
out to see that the drift of the current was towards
the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a
crossing; so I changed off and went that way.

It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings;
so I was a good long time in getting over. I
made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I
couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking
along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or
more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned
double log house before I noticed it. I was going
to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped
out and went to howling and barking at me, and I
knowed better than to move another peg.
