promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn't
cuss him no more.

Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped
they was going to say he could have one or two of the
chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or
could have meat and greens with his bread and
water; but they didn't think of it, and I reckoned
it warn't best for me to mix in, but I judged I'd get
the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as
soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying
just ahead of me--explanations, I mean, of how I
forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was
telling how him and me put in that dratted night
paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.

But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to
the sick-room all day and all night, and every time
I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.

Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better,
and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. So
I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I
reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that
would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very
peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was
when he come. So I set down and laid for him to
wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding
in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned
me to be still, and set down by me, and begun
to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because
all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been
sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better
and peacefuler all the time, and ten to one he'd
wake up in his right mind.
