"Yes--easy enough. Every animal is grateful for
kindness and petting, and they wouldn't {{think}} of

"But de trouble all {{done}} ef de snake bite me while
I's a-tryin' him. Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle
mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable, but ef you en
Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame,
I's gwyne to {{leave}}, dat's {{shore}}."
