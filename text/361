know, I don't see them nor have nothing to do with
them except when they're on me; and I don't believe
I've ever lost one of them {{off}} of me."

"Well, it ain't {{your}} fault if you haven't, Silas;
you'd 'a' done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt
ain't all that's gone, nuther. Ther's a spoon gone;
and {{that}} ain't all. There was ten, and now ther's
only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the
calf never took the spoon, {{that's}} certain."

"Why, what else is gone, Sally?"

"Ther's six {{candles}} gone--that's what. The rats
could 'a' got the candles, and I reckon they did; I
wonder they don't walk off with the whole place, the
way you're always going to stop their holes and
don't do it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in
your hair, Silas--{{you'd}} never find it out; but you
can't lay the {{spoon}} on the rats, and that I {{know}}."

"Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it;
I've been remiss; but I won't let to-morrow go by
without stopping up them holes."

"Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. Matilda
Angelina Araminta {{Phelps!}}"

Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches
her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling
around any. Just then the nigger woman steps onto
the passage, and says:

"Missus, dey's a sheet gone."

"A {{sheet}} gone! Well, for the land's sake!"

"I'll stop up them holes to-day," says Uncle Silas,
looking sorrowful.

"Oh, {{do}} shet up!--s'pose the rats took the {{sheet?}}
{{Where's}} it gone, Lize?"
