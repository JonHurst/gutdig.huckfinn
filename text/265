Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like
they hadn't ever expected it, and then like they {{had}}.
Then the duke says:

"What, {{all}} of them?"

"No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don't
think I ever see them all come {{out}} at once but just one
time."

"Hello! When was that?"

"It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning.
It warn't early, because I overslept. I was
just starting down the ladder, and I see them."

"Well, go on, {{go}} on! What did they do? How'd
they act?"

"They didn't do nothing. And they didn't act
anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away;
so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in there to
do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing
you was up; and found you {{warn't}} up, and so they
was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without
waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you
up."

"Great guns, {{this}} is a go!" says the king; and
both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly.
They stood there a-thinking and scratching their
heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a
little raspy chuckle, and says:

"It does beat all how neat the niggers played their
hand. They let on to be {{sorry}} they was going out of
this region! And I believed they {{was}} sorry, and so
did you, and so did everybody. Don't ever tell {{me}}
any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent.
Why, the way they played that thing it would fool
