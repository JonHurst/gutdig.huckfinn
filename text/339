“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway?
What made you think somebody sung out?”

“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I
was dead, I do. Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do
mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so. Please to don’t tell
nobody ’bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole me;
’kase he say dey {{ain’t}} no witches. I jis’ wish to goodness
he was heah now – {{den}} what would he say! I
jis’ bet he couldn’ fine no way to git aroun’ it {{dis}}
time. But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s {{sot}}, stays
sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’ en fine it out f’r deyselves,
en when {{you}} fine it out en tell um ’bout it,
dey doan’ b’lieve you.”

Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody;
and told him to buy some more thread to tie
up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:

“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.
If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful
enough to run away, {{I}} wouldn’t give him up, I’d
hang him.” And whilst the nigger stepped to the
door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was
good, he whispers to Jim and says:

“Don’t ever let on to know us. And if you hear
any digging going on nights, it’s us; we’re going to
set you free.”

Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and
squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said
we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted us
to; and he said he would, more particular if it was
dark, because the witches went for him mostly in
the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.
